Git hooks for automatic building of ctags indexes

> In case you’ve been living under a programming rock, Ctags (specifically
> [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/), not the BSD version shipped
> with OS X) indexes source code to make it easy to jump to functions,
> variables, classes, and other identifiers in (among other editors) Vim (see
> `:help tags`). The major downside to Ctags is having to manually rebuild that
> index all the time. That’s where the
> [not-so-novel](http://smartic.us/2009/04/03/creating-ctags-with-git-hooks/)
> idea of re-indexing from various Git commit hooks comes in.
